**Correctness:** PyTorch vs ONNX Runtime: **PASS** (loss diff 3.2e-3).
PyTorch vs JAX: **PASS** (loss diff 3.2e-3).
PyTorch vs Meganeura: **PASS** (max error 1.7e-6, loss diff 5.3e-3).
PyTorch vs llama.cpp: **PASS** (loss diff 4.5e-3). Candle, Luminal: **CLOSE**.
Struck-through values are from frameworks running a different (simplified) model.

## Architecture

LLaMA-family transformer with Grouped Query Attention:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Hidden size | 576 |
| Layers | 30 |
| Attention heads | 9 (3 KV heads, GQA) |
| FFN intermediate | 1536 |
| Vocab size | 49152 |
| Context length | 2048 |
| Activations | SiLU / SwiGLU |
| Normalization | RMSNorm |
| Position encoding | RoPE |

## What this exercises

- Matrix multiplications (Q/K/V projections, FFN up/gate/down)
- Grouped Query Attention with causal masking
- Rotary Position Embeddings
- RMSNorm (2 per layer, 60 total)
- SwiGLU activation fusion
- Embedding lookup + tied lm_head

## Caveats

- **PyTorch** and **Meganeura** load real model weights and run the full
  architecture — their outputs match.
- **Candle** runs the real LLaMA architecture with the same safetensors
  weights, but its `forward()` returns last-position logits only (private
  fields prevent getting all-position logits). Loss is computed on 1
  position vs 128 for others — hence DIFFERENT MODEL in correctness check.
  Timing is valid. Backward not yet wired.
- **Burn** and **Luminal** use a simplified model (single-head attention,
  no RoPE/RMSNorm) with random weights.
- Luminal backward is estimated as a second forward pass.
